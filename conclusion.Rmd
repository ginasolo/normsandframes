title: "Conclusions"

Running the additional analysis was helpful in terms of being able to look at the invididual performance of each treatment group. We still maintain that the control group was not necessary since what we really need to evaluate was the Emirpical and Normative/Positive and Negative conditions. And, while we cannot claim a significant effect at the p <.05 level between positive and negative frames, our results suggest that participants viewing negatively-framed messages may have behaved more honestly. 


This potential result contrasts with our hypothesis. Findings could potentially be explained by Levin, Schneider, and Gaeth’s (1998) conclusion that negative frames tend to be more effective in goal framing-type designs, which we think align with our experimental design. Loss aversion was a possible explanation as to why this was the case, such that negative frames motivate people to avoid loss, which proves to be more salient than the corresponding positive frames, which motivate gains.  This rationale seemingly falls in line with Prospect Theory. With our negatively framed messages, we expressed to participants that the minority either “did not truthfully report”, or “didn’t approve of truthfully reporting” dice rolls. It may be that the participants in the negative frame realized they could confirm to dishonest behavior, which could also have been construed as unpopular given the cue that the minority confirmed to it.  Therefore, the argument could be made that participants experienced dissonance relating to a sort of “social loss”, which they became motivated to avoid, and thus tell the truth.

Across all treatments, there seemed to be a fairly consistent percentage of people who were bound to tell the truth irrespective of the frame.  There also existed a subset of people who, most of the time, were going to lie to maximize gain irrespective of the frame. However, the latter group seemed more susceptible to framing effects, since the amount of “consistent liars” was observably lower in the negative frame treatments compared to positive.  Therefore, if negative frames proved more salient, then conversely it may also be the case that the “social gain” of sorts realized from the positive frame may not have been enough of a deterrent to change the minds of those who seemed to want to lie anyway.

Beyond the discussion on effect of negative framing in cheating behavior, our study is consistent with empirical research suggesting negative is more powerful than positive in general (Bozer et al., 2011). Regarding attitudes, Rucker et al.’s (2008) study revealed anecdotal evidence suggesting that people hold their attitudes with more certainty when there are explicit opposing and supporting sides on a matter, and that opposers hold stronger attitudes than supporters. It might be that by framing messages as minority either “did not truthfully report”, and particularly “didn’t approve of truthfully reporting” dice rolls, we made more salient for participants the existence of a dissident group who opposed the majority and the existence of two sides could be enough to elicit stronger attitudes, in line with Rucker et al (2008).

Therefore, we can hypothesize that participants’ existing attitudes toward not cheating in general, informed by social norms of honesty already in place, were strengthened by the negative framing, resulting in less cheating on average than in positive framing conditions. Utilizing Bicchieri's theory, in which having a preference means that an individual has a disposition to act in a certain way, in a particular situation that requires a choice, we could argue that negatively framed messages reinforced participants` existing conditional preferences of not cheating.

Also, narrow frames, in general, reflect the structure of the environment in which decisions are made. Smith and Petty (1996) found similar results in their study, supported by additional research that when messages are presented in a negative frame, increased cognitive processing may occur, and thus the individual’s decision if that frame produces favorable thoughts. Although, these concepts do not provide rationale for positive versus negative conditions.

Most importantly, we wanted to consider the role of social expectations, and how they may affect individual choice and norm conformity. We found it surprising that despite Bicchieri’s (2016) theory, no effects were determined between normative and empirical expectations. A possible explanation for this finding is that the norm-signaling portion of the message was unable to be differentiated between treatments; (dis)approval in the normative treatment may have been conceptually too similar to the empirical expectation message, even though the theory maintains there is a distinction. Critical components of the theory are conditionality of preference as well as the impact of a meaningful reference network. Likely, social expectations did not matter to choice, such that the behavior of others was not relevant to participants’ decisions to misreport; they were intrinsically motivated.  Lastly, the role of the majority/minority, respective to what others did or approve of, also was not a factor for influencing behavior from a social theory perspective. 

Additionally, the negative framing of “did not truthfully report” and “didn’t approve of truthfully reporting” may have had similar effect of the injunctive norms in Cialdini et al (2006) study in which were more effective in deterrence of negative behavior, in this case theft of wood, than descriptive norms. Particularly, the negative framing “please don`t” of the injunctive norm message resulted in significantly lower levels of theft compared to all other treatments combined, consistent with the effect suggested in normative negative condition, although the results were not significant.
